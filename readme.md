This C program uses the stb_image and stb_image_write libraries to concatenate two images vertically. It supports images with different dimensions by adding zero-padding to the smaller image. The resulting image is saved as "concat.png."

Requirements
stb_image - A single header file for reading images.
stb_image_write - A single header file for writing images.
